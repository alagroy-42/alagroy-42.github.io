      <description>Introduction In our last post, we saw how to make a simple virus that propagates inside ELF 64-bits files but we saw at the end that the way we did it was not really stealthy and the whole point of a malware is to be stealthy to avoid being spotted and removed. To remedy to that, we will now use a new technique that won&amp;rsquo;t raise any suspicions when the infected binary is being inspected with the readelf command.</description>
      <content>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our &lt;a href=&#34;https://alagroy-42.github.io/malware_dev/infector_basics&#34;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt;, we saw how to make a simple virus that propagates inside ELF 64-bits files but we saw at the end that the way we did it was not really stealthy and the whole point of a malware is to be stealthy to avoid being spotted and removed. To remedy to that, we will now use a new technique that won&amp;rsquo;t raise any suspicions when the infected binary is being inspected with the &lt;code&gt;readelf&lt;/code&gt; command. It means neither the number of segments nor their permissions should be changed and the entrypoint will also remain the same. Since our last post has been really detailed about the code, we will now just see the concepts to write a better virus. If you are interested in the code, I did a virus that implements all of these techniques that you can find &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/alagroy-42/Famine&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-do-we-do-that-&#34;&gt;How do we do that ?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will break down this problem in two parts, the first one will be finding a place where we can inject ourself and then we will find a way to get control of the execution flow to execute our payload. To avoid changing the number of load segment, since they are the only one that are mapped into memory, we know that we are going to have to put them here. There are two well-known infection techniques that would respect the constraints and that are safe:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The reverse text segment padding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The text segment padding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those techniques are really efficient and simple to implement but they have the major inconvenient that the padding size depends on the file and we might not be able to inject our payload. That&amp;rsquo;s why we will implement a handcrafted technique of mine which is the code bouncing one. We will explain why later but that technique is not optimal so we will only use it as a backup solution if we cannot insert ourself on the text segment padding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-optimal-solution--the-text-segment-padding&#34;&gt;The optimal solution : the text segment padding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two known techniques evoked above are quite similar in terms of result so I chose the second one which is the &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; text segment padding insertion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ELF format has been made so that memory mapping of file parts is being made easy thanks to the congruency between offsets and address, modulo a page size, which is usually 4096 bytes. That being said, since everything on the same page has the same permissions, code and data cannot be on the same page. That would be a disaster for security if data had execution permissions or if we could rewrite the code. To put code and data on different pages while keeping the offsets aligned on the memory, the only solution is to put some padding after the code segment. Those are unused null bytes, that we can replace with our code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://alagroy-42.github.io/infector_adv_page.png&#34; alt=&#34;pages&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we can see, if the padding is large enough, we can put our payload inside it and make a few modification to some of the ELF structures to map it inside an executable memory segment which is exactly what we want.
To check that we can put our payload inside the padding we can just compute this formula : &lt;code&gt;padding_size = rodata_phdr.p_off - (text_phdr.p_off + test_phdr.p_filesz)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we know that we can infect the file using this technique, we just have to :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;copy the payload in the padding area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;increase the text segment size so that our payload gets mapped into memory at runtime&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;increase the last section of the segment (usually &lt;code&gt;.fini&lt;/code&gt;) so that our payload fit in a section to avoid any suspicion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if everything has been done correctly, the only remaining thing to do is to hijack the execution flow but first let&amp;rsquo;s see whta we can do in case our payload doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-backup-solution--the-code-bouncing&#34;&gt;The backup solution : the code bouncing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we don&amp;rsquo;t have enough place to insert ourselves in the text segment padding, there is still somewhere we can go whatever the size of our payload is : the end of the last segment. Indeed, we can extend it as much as we want to adapt to any payload but the last load segment is usually the data segment which brings two problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the BSS : this section used for uninitialized global and static variables is present in memory but not in the file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the permissions: we said that we don&amp;rsquo;t want to grant any additional permission to our load segments to avoid being spotted with a &lt;code&gt;readelf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s where the code bouncing technique comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let&amp;rsquo;s insert our payload in the data segment. As we said earlier, we want to put our code at the end of the last segment which is the data segment. The data segments usually ends with the BSS section. This section is used for uninitialized static and global variables. Since those are not stored on the stack, the program has to store them somewhere writable so in the data segment. However, since those are uninitialized, storing them in the file would be useless and consume unnecessary space. To address that problem, the BSS section has been created and it will only be present in memory. That is why the &lt;code&gt;filesz&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;memsz&lt;/code&gt; attributes of the Program Header structure are sometimes different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://alagroy-42.github.io/infector_adv_bss.png&#34; alt=&#34;pages&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with that situation is that this memory zone used for the BSS is usually zero-filled and it could be used by the program anyway which would result in our payload being overridden like so :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://alagroy-42.github.io/infector_adv_bss_override.png&#34; alt=&#34;pages&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid this problem, we cannot move the BSS after the payload since it would break all the references to the variables present inside. Something we can do though is writing the BSS. It will ensure the integrity of our code while having no effect on the BSS itself. However it means adding some space in the middle of the file, which will break some offsets and potentially some important part of the files like the section header table. Because we do not want that, we will be careful to conserve the file integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will mean shifting everything that comes after the BSS before writing it and the payload and once we&amp;rsquo;ve done that, we will update the offsets of every section that follows the BSS and the offset of the section header table in the ELF header. With that done, the file structure will remain the same and nothing should be broke, at least not on the execution point of view because nothing is mapped after the BSS. Since we&amp;rsquo;ve updated the offsets, we can still use &lt;code&gt;readelf -t&lt;/code&gt; to check the sections. Everything should be coherent for now but we have to modify the BSS section header which will bring some little abnormal things to &lt;code&gt;readelf&lt;/code&gt;. We have to change its type to &lt;code&gt;SHT_PROGBITS&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;SHT_NOBITS&lt;/code&gt; to get it mapped into memory. We also have to update the size of the BSS to include our payload but also the sizes of the data segment without forgetting that it already counted the BSS but only in the &lt;code&gt;p_memsz&lt;/code&gt; field. Once that is done, we have our code placed in memory but on a non-executable segment, which is a problem because we will segfault if we execute it. We cannot change it in the file to avoid being spotted too easily but we can try to change it at runtime. That is what the code bouncing technique is about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To resolve our current issue, we will insert a short chunk of code in the text padding segment that will grant the execution permission to the data segment using the &lt;code&gt;mprotect&lt;/code&gt; syscall. Once it has made the data segment executable, it will just jump on it to execute it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://alagroy-42.github.io/infector_adv_code_bounce.png&#34; alt=&#34;pages&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-about-the-execution-flow-&#34;&gt;What about the execution flow ?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We achieved our first goal : we have an executable payload mapped into memory no matter its size, the only limit is that the code padding is able to host the code bounce code chunk (≈ 20 bytes). All of that without modifying the number of load segments nor their permissions. There is not any suspicious red flag when looking at the &lt;code&gt;readelf&lt;/code&gt; command on an infected program. For now, our payload is useless though since it is not being executed. Our second task will be executing it without changing the entrypoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do so, we have to find something that gets executed no matter what but that is not the entrypoint. Have you ever tried to compile a simple Hello World in C and then inspect what is in the binary. If not, you should and you will see that there is actually way more than just the main. There is a lot happening before the main gets executed. But the entrypoint is not even main, it usually points on &lt;code&gt;_start&lt;/code&gt;, a wrapper that will call main with the correct arguments. But before that, the loader is doing a lot, it has to map everything, update the relocation call some initialization functions etc&amp;hellip; If you want to know more what happens before the execution of main you can (and you should) read &lt;a href=&#34;http://dbp-consulting.com/tutorials/debugging/linuxProgramStartup.html&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we know all of that, we have a pretty good idea about how we can hijack the execution of a program without changing the entrypoint. There are many ways to do it, I have chosen the constructor hijacking solution. Every program usually has a constructor, some have more (usually C++ programs). If you ever wandered in an executable using &lt;code&gt;objdump&lt;/code&gt;, you have probably already seen the &lt;code&gt;frame_dummy&lt;/code&gt; function that is useless to most of the programs but it is there. It is the only constructor for a normal C program. The addresses of the constructors are stored in a function pointer array present in the &lt;code&gt;.init_array&lt;/code&gt; section. The &lt;code&gt;_init&lt;/code&gt; function, called at the very beginning of a program calls each one of this array entries. To get our payload executed, we simply have to override the first entry of this array with the address of our payload. The advantage of this double technique is that both have their starting point at the same place (in the text segment padding) so we don&amp;rsquo;t have to take the payload place into account when we override the address. Now this should work for normal executables but there is still a problem to handle. On PIE executable, the &lt;code&gt;.init_array&lt;/code&gt; entries are in the relocation table (in the &lt;code&gt;.rela.dyn&lt;/code&gt; section) which means that the loader is actually gonna replace their address by the value indicated in the relocation field so we also have to modify the &lt;code&gt;r_addend&lt;/code&gt; field of these to indicate to the program where the function is gonna be once the executable has been mapped in a random place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that all of that is patched, we have a working ELF infector that does not show anything suspicious on the &lt;code&gt;readelf&lt;/code&gt; command and that does not change the entrypoint either. That is a good start for a stealth malware. On our way to stealthiness, we will learn a few more things like code obfuscation or oligomorphism (self-encryption) but first, let&amp;rsquo;s have some fun and &lt;a href=&#34;https://alagroy-42.github.io/malware_dev/simple_backdoor&#34;&gt;let&amp;rsquo;s add a backdoor to our virus to gain remote access on infected computers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this post, we will learn how to code a simple ELF infector on Linux. This infector will spread and sel-replicate inside the other binaries that it finds. It will get executed when infected binaries are launched so that it can spread even more. The payload will be harmless, just a signature to attest that the binary has been infected. This infector will be very basic and undisguised at all, any reverse-engineer could see that a file has been infected by executing a simple &lt;code&gt;readelf&lt;/code&gt; command (We will get more into that later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check the full source code &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/alagroy-42/note_infector&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-does-it-work-&#34;&gt;How does it work ?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technique that we will use here is called PT_NOTE segment hijacking. To understand how it works, we first need to understand the ELF format. The first element of an ELF file is the ELF header, it gives us the info we need to understand and read the rest of the file. Then comes the Program Header table, it will describe how the file is being organized. Each program header describes a part of the file, a part can belong to several program headers. Each entry is described by the following C structure (&lt;code&gt;man elf&lt;/code&gt; for more information).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c&#34; data-lang=&#34;c&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;typedef&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;               &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;uint32_t&lt;/span&gt;   p_type;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;               &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;uint32_t&lt;/span&gt;   p_flags;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;               Elf64_Off  p_offset;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;               Elf64_Addr p_vaddr;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;               Elf64_Addr p_paddr;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;               &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;uint64_t&lt;/span&gt;   p_filesz;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;               &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;uint64_t&lt;/span&gt;   p_memsz;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;               &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;uint64_t&lt;/span&gt;   p_align;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;           } Elf64_Phdr;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;p_type&lt;/code&gt; field describes what kind of program header it is. There are two types that interests us :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;PT_LOAD: The array element specifies a loadable segment, described by p_filesz and p_memsz. The bytes from the file are mapped to the beginning of the memory segment. If the segment&#39;s memory size p_memsz is larger than the file size p_filesz, the &amp;quot;extra&amp;quot; bytes are defined to hold the value 0 and to follow the segment&#39;s initialized area. The file size may not be larger than the memory size. Loadable segment entries in the program header table appear in ascending order, sorted on the p_vaddr member.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;PT_NOTE: The array element specifies the location of notes (ElfN_Nhdr).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;PT_LOAD&lt;/code&gt; are being loaded in memory which means that with the right permissions, we can execute the content of it. The &lt;code&gt;PT_NOTE&lt;/code&gt; simply gives the location of notes that are useless for the program during its execution. There should be a &lt;code&gt;PT_NOTE&lt;/code&gt; segment on every binary compiled the usual way. The technique will consists in changing this &lt;code&gt;PT_NOTE&lt;/code&gt; segment to a &lt;code&gt;PT_LOAD&lt;/code&gt; pointing to the end of the file where we will put our code. This way, it will be mapped into memory without altering the file too much and we will be able to execute it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To execute it, we will look a bit more at the ELF header structure defined as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c&#34; data-lang=&#34;c&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;#define EI_NIDENT 16
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;           &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;typedef&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;               &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;unsigned&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;char&lt;/span&gt; e_ident[EI_NIDENT];
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;               &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;uint16_t&lt;/span&gt;      e_type;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;               &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;uint32_t&lt;/span&gt;      e_flags;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The field that interests us here is &lt;code&gt;e_entry&lt;/code&gt; which will define the entrypoint of our program. If we put our code, the program will execute it and we will just have to transfer the execution back to the original entrypoint so that the program can keep its course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-code&#34;&gt;The code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;filesystem-reading&#34;&gt;Filesystem reading&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing to do will be finding files to infect. For safety reason and because we don&amp;rsquo;t want to launch our program as root, we will not look for those in &lt;code&gt;/bin&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;/usr/bin&lt;/code&gt; but in &lt;code&gt;/tmp/test&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/tmp/test2&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

To use those files then, we want to open them with relative paths to avoid string operations that are a bit painful in ASM so we will use &lt;code&gt;chdir&lt;/code&gt; to open them directly. Our first step to avoid breaking the infected program (eg &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt;) will be to open our current working directory to be able to get back to it once the job is done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;infect&lt;/code&gt; function will be the main function of our program. To make the code more clean, I&amp;rsquo;ve defined a structure called &lt;code&gt;Infection_struct&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;defines.s&lt;/code&gt; that will allow me, by considering the stack frame as this structure to use its fields as local variable names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The file is a valid ELF file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is either an executable file or a shared object file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has not been infected yet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it is useless and memory-consuming to reinfect a file, we will prevent that to append. In the &lt;code&gt;e_ident&lt;/code&gt; field of the ELF header, there are some padding bytes that are unused and zero-filled. We will put an infection marker here to keep track of the already infected binaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;sub&lt;/span&gt;     rax, [rsp &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; inf_map]                &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;; We convert our infected segment&amp;#39;s address to&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the code that will handle the &lt;code&gt;PT_NOTE&lt;/code&gt; hijacking. If we want our program to execute, we need the new &lt;code&gt;PT_LOAD&lt;/code&gt; header to be valid so we will have to change a lot of its fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;p_type&lt;/code&gt;: We will switch it from &lt;code&gt;PT_NOTE&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;PT_LOAD&lt;/code&gt; to tell the system that we want to map our code into the memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;p_flags&lt;/code&gt;: For &lt;code&gt;PT_LOAD&lt;/code&gt; segments, this field is used to define the permissions that will be granted to our segment. We will give it read and execute permissions because that&amp;rsquo;s all ot needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;p_offset&lt;/code&gt;: This field defines here the segment starts, since we are gonna put our code at the end of the file, we will put the file size value here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;p_file/memsz&lt;/code&gt;: Those are used to tell the system the place it needs to reserve in memory and how many bytes of the file it has to put in. We will define both as the virus length (We will see how to get it later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;p_p/vaddr&lt;/code&gt;: Those are the physical and virtual addresses where the segment will be mapped. It is said in the man that &lt;code&gt;Loadable process segments must have congruent values for p_vaddr and p_offset, modulo the page size.&lt;/code&gt; so we will take the page right after the last already existing &lt;code&gt;PT_LOAD&lt;/code&gt; and then add it the file size so that we are sure that he offset and addresses values have congruent values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;p_align&lt;/code&gt;: Loadable segments are aligned on memory pages so we will change it to the usual size of a page (0x1000 bytes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once our new segment has been created, it is time to put the code inside the file. Since we are working with a memory mapped file, we need to remap it to extend it first. Once this has been done, we just go to the previous end of the file and we copy the payload there. To get the size of our payload, we use the &lt;code&gt;_end&lt;/code&gt; beacon that we put at the end so that we can define &lt;code&gt;virus_len&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code&gt;_end - _start&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once our payload has been copied, the last step is to hijack the control flow to get it executed. To do that we will first add the following lines to &lt;code&gt;_start&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-nasm&#34; data-lang=&#34;nasm&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;jmp&lt;/span&gt;     _end
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;final_jmp_offset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt; equ&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; _start
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this line, the program will cleanly quits after its first execution. We can also use this &lt;code&gt;jmp&lt;/code&gt; to jmp back to the original entrypoint after the virus execution. In x86_64 assembly, a jump is encoded as &lt;code&gt;opcode relative_offset&lt;/code&gt; starting from the &lt;code&gt;final_jmp_offset&lt;/code&gt; label.
We can obtain this offset with the formula : &lt;code&gt;old_entrypoint_address - final_jmp_offset&lt;/code&gt;.
Once we replaced the jmp address in the copied code, everything is set but there is still one thing to do for the infector to fully work : preserve its registers.
Indeed, the host program code might expect some special values in some register that we used (like &lt;code&gt;argc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;argv&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;rdi&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;rsi&lt;/code&gt;) so we will push those important registers at the very beginning of our program and pop them just before the final jump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can now infect any ELF 64-bits of our system and get anything executed executed by it if we insert a real payload inside but we have a problem : our technique is not stealthy at all, we can be spotted by &lt;code&gt;readelf&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;readelf&lt;/code&gt; is a linux command that allows us to inspect ELF files, we will use it with the &lt;code&gt;-l&lt;/code&gt; option to display the program headers of a simple Hello World coded in C before and after infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Elf file type is DYN (Shared object file)

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is how a normal file looks like, it has 4 load segments including a single one that is executable for the code and a single one that is writable for the data segment. It also has a NOTE header that is containing notes about the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the infection, it will look more like :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can now see that there is another load segment which has execution permissions. It is super weird and should not be there at all, we can also notice that obviously, the NOTE segment disappeared. Another odd thing is the fact that the entrypoint is pointing on that segment. The code segment is almost always mapped at 0x1000 and the entrypoint is usually at the beginning of it so 0x70e0 definitely doesn&amp;rsquo;t look legit.
This is how you can see that this file is not legitimate and probably infected without even the need to properly analyze it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucky for us, we are gonna learn how to make an infector that will not induce any peculiar change in the ELF file structure. It will keep the original entrypoint and it will not change the number of load segments nor their permissions.&lt;/p&gt;
